      <h3>The Company</h3>
      <p>
        As we were looking through some lists of newly-funded startups, we found
        tons of cool new companies. One that caught our eye was <a href="https://www.lactationlab.com/">Lactation Lab</a>,
        a company which aims to help breastfeeding parents know what's in their milk.
      </p>
      <p>
        We chose the startup Lactation Lab, which provides breast milk analysis and personalized recommendations for mothers to optimize their child's health and nutrition. Lactation Lab sells breast milk test analysis kits, such that a user sends in a sample with a purchased kit and can choose from a selection of tests to be run on their sample. We chose to focus on a desktop website interface, as people are more likely to online shop on a computer and because the results and recommendations are only given once and not updated, so they are not something a user would be constantly checking, which would work better on mobile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users for this site would likely be breastfeeding parents (possibly repeat customers), that care about their health and the health of their children, as they would be able to ensure their milk is optimized for that purpose. This site may also attract users that are very interested in natural breastfeeding and normalizing breastfeeding because they would be willing to invest in this passion, despite being expensive. This startup also donates test kits to hospitals, so some clients would be parents at this hospital or the hospital themself who received a donation.
      </p>
      <h3>Sketches</h3>
      <p>As a group, we each created a set of three sketches with the goal
        of getting any and all ideas flowing, even ones which seemed a little
        off the wall. Here are four of our favorites.</p>
      <h3>Lo-Fi Mockup</h3>
      <p>After comparing sketches and chatting about our ideas, we came to the conclusion
      that we wanted to include a basic questionnaire to help parents understand which
      testing package would fit them best, as well as a test results page and further information on nutrients.
      We also included a page with all products and an ordering page.</p>

      <h3>Initial Hi-Fi Prototype</h3>
      <p>We created an interactive prototype based on the lo-fi mockup we created. In particular, we made
      the initial questionnaire entirely interactive and designed a new logo for the company, which incorporates
      a droplet outline with a graph-like zigzag.</p>

      <h3>Critique</h3>
      <p>Using our initial hi-fi prototype, we participated in a critique session. We received lots of
      useful feedback! Some suggestions were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Include a clear explanation on the homepage of what product is or what the startup is trying to accomplish, in text or other media.</li>
        <li>Include a description of the different kits â€“ perhaps product pages?</li>
        <li>Provide the option to go straight from quiz results to the ordering page.</li>
        <li>Perhaps for a future iteration - think about adding a subscription page or a cart.</li>
        <li>UI Notes: Make buttons shadowed so it's more obvious that they're clickable, align text and flowchart on homepage.</li>
        <li>Add some more charts or graphs to results page.</li>
        <li>Remove navigation on payment page.</li>
        <li>On product pages, change plus signs to something else, since they give the impression of adding to cart, not expanding.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Post-Critique Revisions</h3>
      <p>Based on this feedback, we made a final iteration of our prototype, largely focusing on providing more information for users about what they are actually purchasing on the homepage, before ordering, and graphically in results, but also incorporating all other smaller pieces of feedback we received.</p>

      <h3>Reflection and Takeaways</h3>
      <p>It was interesting to go through the full process from ideation to iteration with critique!</p>
